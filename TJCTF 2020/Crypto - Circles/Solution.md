## Challenge: Circles

### Prompt:
> Written by jpes707 Some typefaces are mysterious, like this one - its origins are an enigma wrapped within a riddle, indeed.

![Circles](Circles.png)

### Solution:
Googling the description brought me to [this](https://www.fonts.com/font/mans-greback/notera/story) page, but searching "circle" and "sphere" weren't helpful (I later learned that "circular" would have given me the answer immediatly). Neither was looking through the [Notera author's](https://www.fonts.com/font/aring-typeface-ab) page.

I eventually found a few sites that allowed me to search for fonts by uploading an image. The 3rd such [site](https://www.whatfontis.com/) showed me the font [USF Circular Designs](https://www.fonts.com/font/ultimate-symbol/usf-circular-designs), which matched the font in the picture.

Decoding the message gave the flag `tjctf{B3auT1ful_f0Nt}`.
